## Rankings

Each algorithm appears twice on adjacent rows, distinguished by the `Gate` column: `ungated` takes every signal that meets the entering condition, `R>=40` takes a trade only if its `QullamaggieRanking` score (`turtlex/strategy/ranking/qullamaggie.py`) clears the gate. The two rows come from the same signals, held and exited identically, so the difference isolates the gate — the drop in `N` between them is how selective it is. The score uses the same shift-1 indicators the entry filter used (`adr_pct`, `pct_vs_sma50`) plus the raw signal-date close, so it adds no look-ahead. Rows are ordered by SMA threshold (s20, s16, s12), ungated before gated.

## Findings & Caveats

### Ideas to improve

- source point-in-time market cap (or shares outstanding × price at entry) instead of a static snapshot
- source a delisted-ticker history if available to address survivorship
- add a slippage/commission assumption on top of the next-day-open fill
- widen the gate sweep past 40 to find where the score stops separating outcomes
- report the ranking's own decile spread within a fixed X so the gate's effect can be read independently of the SMA threshold
- account for trade overlap (e.g. block-bootstrap or effective-sample-size adjustment) when judging Sortino confidence
- re-run all three windows (2010-2015, 2016-2020, 2021-present) before accepting any parameter change — a change that only improves the window it was chosen on is fitted to that window
- pick the ranking gate per SMA threshold rather than one R≥40 across s12/s16/s20; the same score rejects a very different share of each, so it is not the same filter at each
- report per-year Sortino again — the Yrs+/Consistent columns were dropped from the table, so a combination that only works in one year is no longer visible at a glance
